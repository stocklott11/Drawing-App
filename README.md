## Overview

I created this Drawing App to build my skills with TypeScript and see how it can make JavaScript projects more organized, reliable, and scalable. The app lets you draw freely on an HTML5 canvas, change brush color and size, clear the canvas, and save your work as a PNG image.

My goal was to get hands-on experience with how TypeScript adds structure and type safety to everyday coding tasks. This project helped me understand how classes, modules, and real-time browser events all come together in a web app. It also gave me a better appreciation for how TypeScript can catch small mistakes before they cause bigger problems.
